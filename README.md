# Insta-Activity
Its the practice of the backend where I have tried to perform an activity of how data comes from database and rendered. 
How templates work.
How we use ejs and its tags.

# Insta like page
Its basically insta like page where the followers, following, image of the user and the likes, comments are displayed.
The data comes from a json file we have in the index dir. 
There are two users data in file so it displays only their information and for any other user account it displays no account found.
